# Hobbies Website

A website I'm creating with the intent to learn more about
full stack web development. Ideally, I will also be able
to implement various tools that will help me improve my
hobbies and daily life.

The frontend of the site will be built off of React and 
Bulma/Bootstrap.

The backend will be built with Flask.
